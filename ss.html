“Imagine a traveler from the city longing for a peaceful village escape — 
but they don’t know where to go, what to expect, or how to book.
Meanwhile, in the village, a farmer has an extra room, local food, and cultural stories to share — 
but no way to connect with tourists.VillageStay bridges this gap.”
